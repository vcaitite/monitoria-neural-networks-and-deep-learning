# Neural Networks and Deep Learning Tutoring

This repository contains materials, experiments, and exercises developed for **tutoring sessions in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Deep Learning (DL)**.  
It includes Jupyter Notebooks with practical implementations, tests with different architectures, and performance comparisons.

## Repository Contents

- `exerc√≠cio_1.ipynb`: First exercise notebook introducing basic experiments with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and validation analysis.
- Future notebooks and scripts will expand on:
  - Activation functions comparison
  - Minimal topology search
  - Model evaluation and visualization
  - Deep Learning applications

## Goals

- Provide **hands-on practice** with Neural Networks and Deep Learning concepts.  
- Serve as a **study companion** for students learning ANN/DL.  
- Experiment with different model configurations, optimizers, and architectures.  

## Requirements

The notebooks are written in **Python 3** and use standard scientific libraries.  
Make sure you have the following installed:
